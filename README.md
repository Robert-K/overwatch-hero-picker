Overwatch's hero selection is first come, first served. It isn't bad by itself as it allows players to quickly switch to adapt to different situations and the enemy team. However, trying out new heroes or playing one hero consistently to get better is almost impossible as someone usually is faster than you by a fraction of a second. That's not really fair. And not fun either. That's why I made this.
While using Overwatch Hero Picker, please remember that you have a payload to push and a team to help. Maybe it's not a bad idea to switch to a healer once in a while. Looking at you, Genji.

# Add heroes or use with resolutions other than 1920x1080
The file [Hero List.txt](Hero List.txt) contains a list of all hero icons and their corresponding x position on screen.
You can add heroes or correct the position of existing ones after an update or for a different resolution.
Simply take a screenshot of the hero selection screen and use pretty much any image editor to acquire a certain icon's coordinates.
